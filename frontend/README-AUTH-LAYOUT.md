# Auth Layout Implementation

## Overview
The authentication layout has been updated to implement a responsive split-screen design as requested in the requirements.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Split-Screen Design
- **Desktop**: Side-by-side layout with hero section on the left and forms on the right
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout with compact hero header above the form

### 2. Image Integration Placeholder
- A placeholder has been implemented in `HeroSection.tsx` for the provided image
- Location: Lines with `TODO` comment referencing the image URL
- The placeholder is designed to be easily replaceable with the actual image

### 3. Responsive Design
- **Desktop (lg+)**: Full split-screen with hero section taking left half
- **Mobile**: Compact header with logo and tagline, then full-width form

### 4. Accessibility Features Maintained
- All ARIA labels preserved
- Keyboard navigation working correctly
- Screen reader compatibility maintained
- Focus management intact

### 5. Form Design Updates
- Forms work seamlessly in the new layout
- Consistent styling maintained
- All existing functionality preserved

## How to Add the Provided Image

To integrate the image from the provided URL, update the `HeroSection.tsx` file:

1. Add the image to the `public` folder or use the URL directly
2. Replace the placeholder div (look for `TODO` comment) with:
   ```jsx
   <img 
     src="/path-to-your-image.jpg" 
     alt="Featured auth image"
     className="w-full h-full object-cover rounded-2xl shadow-2xl"
   />
   ```
