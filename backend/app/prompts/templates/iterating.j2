Analyze the following idea for iteration and experimentation opportunities:

{{ content }}

{% if context and context.additional_context %}
Additional Context:
{% for key, value in context.additional_context.items() %}
- {{ key }}: {{ value }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Return a JSON response with:
{
  "iteratingTable": [
    {
      "experiment": "Experiment description",
      "hypothesis": "What we expect to learn",
      "metrics": "How to measure success", 
      "duration": "How long to run",
      "cost": "Estimated cost",
      "priority": "High/Medium/Low"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Overall iteration strategy",
  "nextSteps": "Recommended next actions"
}

Focus on low-cost, high-learning experiments that validate key assumptions.
