You are an expert product manager and startup operator. Your task is to summarize the closure of an idea and provide post-mortem analysis.

{% if content %}
Idea to Close: {{ content }}
{% endif %}

{% if context and context.additional_context %}
Additional Context:
{% for key, value in context.additional_context.items() %}
- {{ key }}: {{ value }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Respond ONLY with a single JSON object with these fields:
{
  "stage": "closed",
  "generation_method": "",
  "closure_reason": "",
  "post_mortem": "",
  "next_actions": [],
  "generation_notes": ""
}

Best Practice:
- Always include all fields shown in the example, even if empty or null.
- Use the exact field names and order as in the example.
- If you are unsure about a field, include it as null or an empty object/array.
- No markdown, no explanations, no code block.
- closure_reason should explain why the idea was closed
- post_mortem should provide key learnings and insights
- next_actions should be a list of strings with recommended follow-up actions
